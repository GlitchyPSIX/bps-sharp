C# port from the "CPS" JS-based BPS patcher by [Alcaro](https://github.com/Alcaro) [(link to web version)](https://media.smwcentral.net/Alcaro/bps/]), which is in itself a port of the BPS.

Attempting to enter the world of `async`, ported over to a .NET library with a sample program that patches a single ROM (CLI).

### Disclaimer

I do not own "beat", nor I have written the base code for bps patching. Credit goes to byuu (original creator) and Alcaro.
